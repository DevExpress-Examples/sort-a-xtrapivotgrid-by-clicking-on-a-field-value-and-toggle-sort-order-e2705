# Sort a XtraPivotGrid by clicking on a field value and toggle sort order


<p>This example is based on the "<a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E1434">How to sort a XtraPivotGrid by clicking on a field value</a>" example. It adds the sort order toggling functionality and overrides field values drawing if all sorted fields have the same sort order.</p>
